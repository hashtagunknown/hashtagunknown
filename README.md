<h1 align="left">Hello, world! ðŸŒŒ</h1>

<p align="left">
  I know six programming languages, write clean code in four of them, and automate the rest. 
  I speak Python more fluently than English on most days â€” and yes, I debug in my sleep.

<h2 align="left">About me</h2>

<p align="left">
  ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Sahibnoor â€” a 2nd-year CS undergrad (AI & ML) from GGSIPU ðŸŽ“<br><br>
  I build smart systems that actually do stuff â€” from trading bots that sniff out alpha ðŸ“ˆ to dashboards that decode market noise ðŸ“Š.<br><br>
  ðŸ§  I vibe with all things AI, quant finance, and Web3 â€” especially when there's a chance to automate, optimize, or experiment. 
  Whether itâ€™s writing C++ orderbooks, hunting for arbitrage in prediction markets, or designing computer vision models, 
  I like being at the edge of what tech can do.
</p>

<h4 align="left">ðŸ”§ Current Focus</h4>

<p align="left">
  â€¢ Exploring deep learning for computer vision through WorldQuant University ðŸ§ª<br>
  â€¢ Building intelligent tools for trading, automation, and market analytics ðŸ“Š<br>
  â€¢ Contributing to open-source, hackathons, and real-world tech stacks ðŸ’»<br>
  â€¢ Exploring internship opportunities in AI, quant, and systems roles ðŸš€
</p>

<p align="left">
  ðŸ’¬ Iâ€™m always down to brainstorm tech ideas, jam at a hackathon, or collaborate on cool AI/fintech tools. 
  If you like building ambitious stuff that doesnâ€™t feel like homework, letâ€™s talk.<br><br>
